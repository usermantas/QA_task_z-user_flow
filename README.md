# user_flow

One of the most critical areas in Zyro.com is Payment for Website Builder plan. Why?
1. According to the structure, without successful payment user cannot begin create his own website. So if the payment is not successful - everything stops here.
2. Smooth payment is also important for Zyro.com stakeholders and further project maintenance/developing.
3. If there are issues with payment, it can create bad user experience and user can start thinking "Ok. Problems here, in the first step. What's next?" and choose another market product.
Please find attached User flow diagram which shows payment for Website Builder plan when user is not logged in. It would be just a little difference in the first flow steps, if the user would be logged in. From all steps it is possible to come one step back, so I haven't shown it because of diagram clearness and readability.
